# Project Documentation Index

This directory centralises reference material for the headless e-commerce stack. Each subdirectory focuses on a distinct concern so agents and collaborators can dive directly into what they need.

## Contents

- [API](api/README.md): OpenAPI usage, common workflows, and example calls.
- [Value Objects](value-objects-implementation.md): Design notes for domain value objects.

> Tip: Keep documentation co-located with the code it explains. Feature-level READMEs should live beside their implementation when it improves discoverability.
