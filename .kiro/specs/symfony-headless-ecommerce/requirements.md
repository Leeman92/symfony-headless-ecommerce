# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves building a modern headless e-commerce platform using Symfony with Doctrine ORM, designed to demonstrate the evolution from an intentionally unoptimized version to a highly optimized enterprise-grade system. The platform will serve as both a portfolio showcase and a foundation for future phases including multi-tenancy, AI integration, and advanced performance optimizations.

The system will be built with a "performance journey" approach - starting with a functional but unoptimized implementation that can later be systematically improved to demonstrate senior-level optimization skills through detailed blog documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core E-commerce Foundation

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to browse and purchase products through a modern API-driven interface, so that I can have a seamless shopping experience across different frontend applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer visits the platform THEN the system SHALL provide a RESTful API for product catalog browsing
2. WHEN a customer searches for products THEN the system SHALL return filtered results based on name, category, and price range
3. WHEN a customer adds items to cart THEN the system SHALL persist cart state and calculate totals
4. WHEN a customer proceeds to checkout THEN the system SHALL process orders and update inventory
5. IF a product is out of stock THEN the system SHALL prevent purchase and display availability status

### Requirement 2: Administrative Management

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want to manage products, orders, and customers through a comprehensive API, so that I can efficiently operate the e-commerce business.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a product THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and store product data
2. WHEN an admin updates inventory THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately in the API responses
3. WHEN an admin views orders THEN the system SHALL display order details, status, and customer information
4. WHEN an admin processes an order THEN the system SHALL update order status and send notifications
5. IF an admin attempts unauthorized actions THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 3: Headless Architecture

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to consume a well-documented REST API, so that I can build various client applications (web, mobile, etc.) that interact with the e-commerce backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
2. WHEN a client makes API requests THEN the system SHALL return consistent JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes
3. WHEN a client authenticates THEN the system SHALL provide JWT tokens for subsequent requests
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with clear messages
5. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 429 responses with retry information

### Requirement 4: Performance Demonstration Foundation

**User Story:** As a portfolio viewer, I want to see both unoptimized and optimized versions of the platform, so that I can understand the developer's optimization capabilities and thought process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the unoptimized version runs THEN the system SHALL demonstrate common performance issues (N+1 queries, missing indexes, etc.)
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL expose monitoring endpoints for response times and query counts
3. WHEN load testing occurs THEN the system SHALL handle requests but show clear performance bottlenecks
4. WHEN optimization documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations of performance issues
5. IF performance comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL provide measurable before/after metrics

### Requirement 5: Extensibility for Future Phases

**User Story:** As the project owner, I want the architecture to support future enhancements like multi-tenancy and AI features, so that I can incrementally add advanced capabilities without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is designed THEN the architecture SHALL use repository patterns and dependency injection for easy extension
2. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL support them through configuration rather than core changes
3. WHEN multi-tenant features are needed THEN the system SHALL have database structure that can accommodate tenant isolation
4. WHEN AI integration is required THEN the system SHALL have event-driven architecture for recommendation processing
5. IF scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through stateless design

### Requirement 6: Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a system user, I want my data and transactions to be secure, so that I can trust the platform with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL use secure password hashing and JWT tokens
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate permissions based on user roles
3. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt payment information and personal data
4. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log authentication attempts and access violations
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block requests and alert administrators

### Requirement 7: Data Management with Doctrine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Doctrine ORM with repository patterns, so that I can have clean data access layers and avoid the limitations of Active Record patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL use Doctrine repositories for all database operations
2. WHEN entities are defined THEN the system SHALL use proper Doctrine annotations and relationships
3. WHEN queries are complex THEN the system SHALL use Doctrine Query Builder or DQL for optimization
4. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL use Doctrine migrations for schema changes
5. IF data integrity is required THEN the system SHALL use Doctrine events and lifecycle callbacks

### Requirement 8: Development and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a professional development environment with proper tooling, so that I can maintain code quality and deploy reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL enforce PSR standards through automated linting
2. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive unit and integration test coverage
3. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers for consistent environments
4. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN the system SHALL automatically test, build, and deploy on successful commits
5. IF code quality issues exist THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment until issues are resolved

### Requirement 9: CI/CD Pipeline and Secret Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps-minded developer, I want a complete CI/CD pipeline with proper secret management, so that I can demonstrate enterprise-level deployment practices and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to repository THEN the system SHALL automatically run all tests and quality checks
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build Docker images and push to Harbor registry
3. WHEN secrets are needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve them securely from HashiCorp Vault
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL use proper secret injection without exposing sensitive data
5. IF any pipeline step fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide clear error feedback
6. WHEN releases are created THEN the system SHALL tag Docker images and create deployment artifacts
7. WHEN multiple environments exist THEN the system SHALL support different deployment targets (staging, production)
