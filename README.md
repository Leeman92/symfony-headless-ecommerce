# Symfony Headless E-commerce Platform

A modern, performance-focused headless e-commerce platform built with Symfony 6.4 LTS, designed to demonstrate the evolution from functional but unoptimized code to enterprise-grade performance through systematic optimization.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project follows a unique "performance journey" approach, intentionally starting with common performance bottlenecks that are systematically optimized across multiple phases. Each phase demonstrates different optimization strategies, from infrastructure changes to code-level improvements.

### ü§ñ Agentic Development Approach

This project showcases modern **AI-assisted development** using Kiro IDE with comprehensive:
- **Steering Documents**: Development standards and guidelines in `.kiro/steering/`
- **Spec-Driven Development**: Structured requirements, design, and task planning in `.kiro/specs/`
- **Systematic Implementation**: Phase-based development with clear deliverables and metrics

The `.kiro` folder demonstrates how to effectively collaborate with AI agents through structured documentation and clear development workflows.

### Key Features

- **Headless Architecture**: RESTful API-first design for maximum flexibility
- **Guest & User Checkout**: Support for both authenticated users and guest purchases
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe payment processing with webhook handling
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics collection and load testing
- **Multi-Phase Optimization**: Systematic performance improvements across 7 phases
- **Enterprise CI/CD**: Complete pipeline with HashiCorp Vault and Harbor registry

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### Phase 1: Traditional Stack (Intentionally Unoptimized)
- **Web Server**: Nginx 1.24
- **PHP Runtime**: PHP-FPM 8.4 (Latest with performance improvements and new features)
- **Framework**: Symfony 6.4 LTS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with JSONB support
- **Cache**: Redis 7.0 (minimal usage)
- **Payment**: Stripe API integration
- **Testing**: PHPUnit + Artillery.io load testing

#### Phase 2+: Optimized Evolution
- **Runtime**: FrankenPHP Worker Mode (60-75% performance improvement)
- **Caching**: Advanced Redis strategies + Varnish HTTP cache
- **Search**: OpenSearch for product discovery and analytics
- **Monitoring**: Grafana + Prometheus for real-time metrics

### Database Strategy: PostgreSQL 16

**Why PostgreSQL over MySQL:**
- Superior ACID compliance and MVCC
- Advanced JSONB support with indexing
- Better query planner and optimizer
- Perfect for flexible product attributes and variants

```sql
-- Example: PostgreSQL JSON queries for product search
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE attributes->>'color' = 'red' 
  AND (attributes->>'size')::text[] && ARRAY['M', 'L'];
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.4+ (Latest version with improved performance, JIT optimizations, and new language features)
- Composer
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (for frontend tooling)
- uv/uvx (for MCP servers)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd symfony-headless-ecommerce
   ```

2. **Set up the project**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
   This will:
   - Create necessary directories
   - Generate SSL certificates for local development
   - Create Docker network
   - Set executable permissions on scripts

3. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   make build
   make start
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

5. **Set up database** (when entities are created)
   ```bash
   make db-create
   make migrate
   ```

6. **Generate JWT keys**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.traditional.yml exec php-fpm-traditional php bin/console lexik:jwt:generate-keypair
   ```

### Access Points

- **Traditional Phase API**: https://traditional.ecommerce.localhost/api
- **Traefik Dashboard**: https://traefik.ecommerce.localhost
- **API Documentation**: https://traditional.ecommerce.localhost/api/doc

**Note**: All services use HTTPS with self-signed certificates. Accept the certificate in your browser for local development.

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/ecommerce

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Stripe (use test keys for development)
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# JWT
JWT_SECRET_KEY=%kernel.project_dir%/config/jwt/private.pem
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=%kernel.project_dir%/config/jwt/public.pem
JWT_PASSPHRASE=your-passphrase
```

## üìä API Documentation

The OpenAPI 3.1 specification is generated with NelmioApiDocBundle and reflects every controller action plus the Symfony JSON login firewall. See [`docs/api/README.md`](docs/api/README.md) for a deeper walkthrough.

### Exploring the Spec

- **Swagger UI**: https://traditional.ecommerce.localhost/api/doc (accept the self-signed certificate). Use the *Authorize* button to provide `Bearer` tokens when trying protected routes.
- **Raw JSON**: https://traditional.ecommerce.localhost/api/doc.json for contract testing, SDK generation, and CLI scripting.
- **Authentication**: Registration and refresh endpoints return structured payloads (`TokenResponse`), while the login route is still handled by the security firewall and returns a raw token envelope.

### Endpoint Families

- **Authentication** ‚Äì register, login, refresh; responses expose user metadata for faster onboarding.
- **Products** ‚Äì browsing plus admin CRUD with exhaustive schemas for variants, SEO, and media.
- **Orders** ‚Äì guest and authenticated checkout, conversion, history, and administrative status updates with explicit guest-email verification rules.
- **Payments** ‚Äì Stripe intent lifecycle, confirmation, lookup, and webhook processing with mixed authentication (JWT or guest email challenge).

Each operation references reusable schema classes from `src/Infrastructure/OpenApi/Schema`, so clients receive consistent error envelopes and pagination metadata.

### Guest Checkout Flow

```bash
# 1. Browse products (no auth required)
curl -k -X GET https://traditional.ecommerce.localhost/api/products

# 2. Guest checkout
curl -k -X POST https://traditional.ecommerce.localhost/api/orders/guest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [{"product_id": 1, "quantity": 2}],
    "guest": {
      "email": "customer@example.com",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe"
    }
  }'

# 3. Process payment with returned intent details
# (Frontend handles Stripe confirmation)

# 4. Optional: Convert to user order after authentication
curl -k -X POST https://traditional.ecommerce.localhost/api/orders/{order_number}/convert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## üå≥ Branching Strategy

### Phase-Based Development

This project uses a phase-based branching strategy optimized for performance demonstration:

```
main (latest completed phase)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-1-traditional (baseline: Nginx + PHP-FPM)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-2-frankenphp (infrastructure optimization)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-3-optimization (code + infrastructure)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-4-varnish (HTTP caching)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-5-opensearch (search optimization)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-6-enterprise (full enterprise features)
```

**Benefits:**
- Each phase branch is a complete, deployable demonstration
- Easy performance comparisons between phases
- Stable baselines for load testing
- Clear evolution for portfolio/blog content
- Independent maintenance and bugfixes per phase

### Development Workflow

1. **Develop on main**: Work on current phase
2. **Complete phase**: Create frozen phase branch (`phase-X-name`)
3. **Continue on main**: Start next phase development
4. **Deploy any phase**: Each branch is independently deployable

## üö¢ Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a complete CI/CD pipeline with:

1. **Quality Gates**: PHPStan, PHP-CS-Fixer, security checks
2. **Testing**: Automated test execution with coverage
3. **Building**: Multi-stage Docker images for different phases
4. **Deployment**: Docker Swarm with HashiCorp Vault secrets
5. **Phase Management**: Automatic deployment based on branch naming

### Secret Management

```bash
# Store secrets in HashiCorp Vault
vault kv put secret/ecommerce/staging \
  database_url="postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/ecommerce" \
  stripe_secret_key="sk_test_..." \
  jwt_secret="your-jwt-secret"
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy.sh staging $COMMIT_SHA
